# HP4951b
I want to run software on my HP4951b serial protocol analyzer.

## Resources

* [HP Bench Briefs MAY-JUNE 1984](http://hparchive.com/Bench_Briefs/HP-Bench-Briefs-1984-05-06.pdf) has an article, **Replacement Parts Cross Reference**, which helps you decode mystery HP part numbers (like 1820-1779) into "generic type" part numbers (like MC14411P) which you can actually find datasheets for.
* [HP 4951B operating and service manual](https://archive.org/details/hp4951b) is actually for the ***HP 4951A***, a not-identical but very similar machine.
